### Added
- Floor instruction (flr)

## REV 234 10/05/2025

### Added
- $PC now gets replaced with the Program Counter
- Firmware Flasher, adds the ability to replace part of the firmware's code. Triggered by holding the F key on boot
- Firmware Success screen
- Call (cll) and Return (ret) Instructions! The call is like jmp but it pushes the program counter before jumping, and ret uses what's at the stack pointer to jump back!

### Changed
- SP and FP don't get automatically replaced anymore, unless they are after a dollar sign. Example: $SP replaces the argument with the Stack Pointer
- Boot process
- Code loader can now load the firmware's code into code memory

###Â Fixed
- Firmware Recovery now resets the screen before displaying, this fixes a bug where the screens could overlap
- Verbose flag now at address 199995 doesn't overlap with the grid height size at 199996 anymore
- Every argument that started with the letter R would be treated as a register, additional check to see if argument's length is smaller than 4
