# Resuming work

After months of inactivity, this is my (late) Christmas gift (more like New-Years gift)
I'm going back to developing Lambda, Nordic/C and Everest as the new Ever Project

<!-- more -->

## So what happened?

After a few quite honestly horrible weeks leading to september which has been my worst time, I took a long break from everything.
Though after a few months I almost managed to get everything together and I found people I could trust.
From there I took some time to think about EverestOS, Lambda, and took them all under one name: the Ever Project

## What this means

Work will slowly come back, firstly by reworking the entire documentation website and documentation to fit with all the changes that have been made to Lambda which haven't been put in the documentation, and then with the rest

## Things are not perfect

I still have a lot of personal work to do, a server to create to organize my entire work under NextCloud and a new relationship to manage so don't expect a lot of changes super quickly. After that I still need to go over the entire project to firstly document it and secondly to learn it all over again.
