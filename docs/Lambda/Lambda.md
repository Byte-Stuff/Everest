# Lambda

# Definition

Lambda is the "hardware" of the Ever project, it acts as the whole computer, aka the CPU, Memory, GPU, screen, etc...
It is powered by LambdaLang, a language close to assembly. To optimize the available space and to make it simpler, Lambda does not work with binary, instead the CPU understands plaintext as is and can run it fine
