# Memory instructions

## Rundown

Use these instructions to manipulate memory around the system. When acting as a program, you are limited by the policies set inside the MMU. If the process acts as the master process of the MMU, you have complete control over the MMU and Memory.
See [MMU](MMU.md) for more info
